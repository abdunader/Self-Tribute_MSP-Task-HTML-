        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Maadi, where my passion for Computers began
          to develop. From an early age, I was fascinated by how computers and
          machines work, which later influenced my educational and career
          choices.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          My educational journey began at Al Fath Al Azhary elementary School,
          followed by Al maadi school for boys. Later, I pursued higher
          education at Helwan University, where I studied Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my academic years, I developed a strong foundation in Computers
          and programming that continues to guide my professional endeavors
          today.
        </p>

        <h3>Career Path</h3>
        <p>
          My professional career started at Vodafone, where I worked as a
          Customer Service representative. This experience taught me valuable
          lessons about Systems in giant companies like Vodafone.

          Currently, I am Data Entry, where I'm focused on dealing with data and
          learning more about data science.

          Outside of my professional life, I enjoy reading, charity work,
          hiking. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and
