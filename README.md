# About Me - Personal Website

## Project Overview

This is a personal website created to showcase my life journey, achievements, and experiences. The website serves as a digital portfolio that highlights who I am, what I've accomplished, and what I'm passionate about.

## Why I Created This Website

I created this website as part of an HTML project to demonstrate my ability to build a fully functional website using semantic HTML. This project allowed me to share my personal story while practicing important web development skills.

## Website Navigation

The website consists of five main pages:

1. **Homepage**: A welcoming introduction with a brief overview of the website.
2. **About Me**: Details about my background, education, career, and personal interests.
3. **Achievements**: A showcase of my professional accomplishments, educational achievements, and personal milestones.
4. **Gallery**: A visual collection of important moments from my life journey.
5. **Contact**: A form that allows visitors to get in touch with me.

## Technical Implementation

The website is built entirely with HTML, focusing on:

- Semantic HTML5 elements for improved accessibility and SEO
- Proper document structure with appropriate heading hierarchy
- Accessible forms with proper labels and attributes
- Responsive images with alt text
- Well-organized navigation

## How to View the Website

You can view the website by:

1. Cloning this repository
2. Opening any of the HTML files in a web browser

Or visit the live version at: [Your GitHub Pages URL or hosting platform]

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance this website by:

- Adding CSS for improved visual design
- Implementing JavaScript for interactive elements
- Expanding the gallery with more images
- Adding a blog section to share my thoughts and experiences
